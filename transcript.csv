12.517,14.517, Hello.,1
14.517,22.517, It's been 30 seconds introducing yourselves.,1
15.499999999999998,18.5, Hello.,0
22.517,24.517," Did we, do you want to get started?",1
24.517,27.517," Oh, that was the time.",1
25.112000000000002,26.112000000000002, Yeah.,2
27.517,34.516999999999996," Okay, overall health positively or negatively, do you go properly?",1
33.86,36.5, Launched your noon.,0
34.516999999999996,44.516999999999996, Okay.,1
35.112,40.112, My answers were pretty on the negative side of my views on the police.,2
40.112,42.112, And how about both of you?,2
44.516999999999996,52.516999999999996, Same.,1
45.379999999999995,56.459999999999994," Personally, I don't have a very neither's positive or negative, just because I don't have",0
52.516999999999996,72.517, Okay.,1
56.459999999999994,59.53999999999999, much direct interaction with them.,0
59.53999999999999,64.42," And then it has to turn to about basically my views, just based on media.",0
64.42,68.38," So I'm holding my, I'm withholding making adjustment here.",0
65.112,66.112, Okay.,2
70.112,71.112, So yeah.,2
73.517,75.517, Does anyone want to add anything?,1
75.112,77.112, I'm just a mind is I grew up in Philadelphia.,2
75.38,88.28," Yeah, I guess one thing that I do have knowledge of is definitely with the school system that",0
75.517,76.517, Lexity.,1
76.517,79.517," Sorry, anything you were going to say.",1
77.112,81.112," So I'm familiar with the Philadelphia Police Department in like,",2
81.112,83.112, they were in our schools.,2
83.112,87.112," They're around the neighborhoods, especially predominantly black and brown neighborhoods.",2
87.112,88.112," So it's like,",2
88.112,90.112, that's where my perspective comes from.,2
88.28,92.22, school is definitely overpoliced.,0
92.22,98.3, And over disciplinary issues that should have been resolved between teachers and students,0
94.112,99.112, Yeah.,2
94.517,95.517, I agree.,1
95.517,96.517, I agree.,1
96.517,102.517, And also the cost taxpayers a lot of money.,1
98.3,103.1, are overpoliced and criminalized and that shouldn't have been the case.,0
102.517,122.517," If you all saw the report from Reinhardt about how they purposely waste money on top of using overly like violent, you know, resort, like resorting to violence to take care of things.",1
103.1,107.74," So with regard to police, presence in schools, in that specific setting, which I have knowledge",0
107.74,111.94," of, I definitely have more negative views.",0
111.94,112.94, Yeah.,0
112.94,122.58," Yeah, I will go with the 10 as well, just because like, again, even though I don't have much",0
122.517,125.517, I feel like pretty negative.,1
122.58,127.46," personal experience interacting with the police, but I think the statistics in research on",0
124.112,126.112, you,2
125.517,128.517, And I understand a stance of being neutral too.,1
127.46,132.1, the topic is strong enough to believe that it is real.,0
128.517,135.517," If you feel like you don't understand enough, that's totally valid.",1
132.1,139.62, But I guess another conversation that I would like to add is that I don't think it's getting,0
139.62,149.9," enough attention in academia, especially is that it's for racism against Asian, not just",0
149.9,159.26," in the punitive way, but also just, I guess, especially with the shooting in California",0
154.112,168.112," And then I forgot about the budget part. I from what I understand, I believe that their budget continues to just increase, increase, increase.",2
159.26,165.22," earlier this year, just how much disbelief and surprise they came out of the reaction that,",0
165.22,168.38," okay, Asian male can shoot too.",0
168.112,180.112," With to my opinion, just from experience, no direct correlation to anything about their community involvement, getting better.",2
168.38,175.06, And that's just kind of ignorance of the problems in the community could also be part of the,0
175.06,180.66," problem, but then understand this scale is different, but with different from what's happening",0
180.112,183.112, voice response.,2
180.66,182.7, in the black and brown community as well.,0
182.7,187.14000000000001," So it's just another thing that I won't do out, but yeah.",0
183.112,187.492, So...,2
183.517,184.517, Right.,1
184.517,185.517, Right.,1
185.517,186.517, Right.,1
186.517,191.517," No, I think homicide rates like in Philly, for example, has increased actually.",1
187.14000000000001,193.42000000000002, Is it just called the Philly DA?,0
188.072,194.31199999999998, Hmm.,2
191.517,193.517," So, I, yeah, I agree.",1
193.42000000000002,196.42000000000002, I'm on PBS website.,0
193.517,203.517," There isn't like a correlation between, you know, police budget and decreasing things that we don't want like homicide.",1
196.42,206.42, Is that a subscription service?,0
197.512,200.792, Hm.,2
201.392,208.492, Great.,2
204.517,219.517," If you get a chance, there's like a great report by the Philadelphia inquireer that talks about how you have people who are like police officers, for example.",1
206.42,226.42," Yeah, it makes sense.",0
213.112,238.832, everybody.,2
219.517,226.517," And then they get, they work with certain doctors that have agreements with them, I guess with the police union.",1
227.517,231.517, To sign off to say that they're not able to serve.,1
231.517,235.517, And then so they might be put on like some type of disability.,1
235.517,238.517," Don't quote me on the facts, but this is the general mark.",1
238.517,247.517, And then so they like will work with another job or something and get paid and then also paid for from the police department.,1
238.832,239.832," Thank you, Madam.",2
247.517,255.517," This is getting the, the paid or there's a post to be police serving on the field and then they like to work in.",1
255.517,258.517, They work as a male cleric or something.,1
256.42,278.14," And if you think about it, I mean, there are definitely aspects of public life that I",0
258.517,264.517, I think Ryan Hart's the city control or supporting.,1
264.517,265.517, Yeah.,1
265.517,279.517," And it's kind of interesting that they're like a union and there's those be like, that's usually more unions are usually like seen as more on the liberal side, but they tend to support like the less liberal side.",1
268.83200000000005,272.35200000000003, You just won't be able to hear aroma for him.,2
272.35200000000003,298.35200000000003, So what extent on a one to ten I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience,2
278.14,285.5," think they should be involved less school as an example, and also in terms of mental",0
280.517,287.517," The conservative side is interesting to see that. Yeah, I kind of don't get it.",1
285.5,292.94," health, that really is not where police should get involved.",0
287.517,296.517," Wait, okay, to what extent do you believe that racism is a problem in policing?",1
292.94,298.06," But on the other hand, like I come from China, and so the our relationship with police is",0
298.06,299.21999999999997, very different.,0
298.35200000000003,306.35200000000003, again and from media across the country of all the police brutality it is of black and brown communities.,2
299.21999999999997,305.7," And also, I visit Europe in Japan as well, like especially in Japan, you can see very strong",0
305.7,311.46," police presence on the streets, but they are seen as a resource for the community.",0
306.35200000000003,322.35200000000003, I in personal experience don't know any white people in my life who ask who have a negative view of the police from their personal experience and it's being directed towards their race so or ethnicity.,2
310.517,314.517, It's very important that we have to be careful.,1
311.46,315.14, You can go to them for help with regard to anything.,0
314.517,318.517, It's very important that we have to be careful.,1
315.14,322.94," If they are not necessarily they are to police, but they are a very wide or public resource",0
318.517,322.517, So there's a lot of people who think that we should be careful.,1
322.35200000000003,330.35200000000003, So the people who do have issues or come into conflict with police are often black and brown.,2
322.517,324.517, We have to be careful.,1
322.94,328.58, in same kind of similar sign in China is some cities and some aspects that could be very,0
324.517,328.517, So there's a lot of people who think that we should be careful.,1
328.517,332.517, So there's a lot of people who think that we should be careful.,1
328.58,331.26, different across the regions.,0
331.26,338.09999999999997," But then I'm just yeah, there could be a different way in what's happening in the US for",0
333.517,335.517, Why that hauls?,1
338.09999999999997,347.09999999999997," the community's relationship, what's the police in terms of offering like really strong",0
338.517,343.517, And I think we have to be careful and based on the awareness that a student takes the care down the line of his position.,1
343.517,352.517," People who have had sexism, non-profitism-remDA crying-",1
347.1,363.62," and unique communities safety, it can happen.",0
352.35200000000003,362.35200000000003, So I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
352.517,359.517, were actually the first major terrible thing on such a long road.,1
359.517,366.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to be better than I am.,1
363.62,369.66," Most like patrol police, like the kind of police that we have in communities, most of them",0
366.517,373.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to be better than I am.,1
369.66,371.78000000000003, don't carry arms.,0
371.78,378.05999999999995," And they are police working in charge of crimes, and there are police where more of problems",0
373.517,377.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to be better than I am.,1
377.517,380.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to be better than I am.,1
378.05999999999995,382.5, are being kind of people in those ones don't carry guns.,0
380.517,383.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to be better than I am.,1
382.35200000000003,392.35200000000003, So I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
382.5,386.65999999999997," And of course, we don't have gun rights, it's not a thing.",0
383.517,387.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to be better than I am.,1
386.65999999999997,391.78, So it really felt like a negative feedback loop here in the US that you gave people the,0
387.517,394.517, I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to be better.,1
391.78,399.78," right to have guns, and then you have police to be more violent, which yes, kind of a",0
392.35200000000003,402.35200000000003, So I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
394.517,401.517," I don't want to be, I don't want to do anything I'm going to do.",1
399.78,405.21999999999997," negative feedback loop, which is definitely not the case in Japan or China or Europe, why",0
401.517,406.517," I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be, I don't want to be I don't want to be.",1
402.35200000000003,412.35200000000003, So I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
405.21999999999997,407.21999999999997, is it Europe at least?,0
406.517,408.517," Yeah, I agree.",1
408.517,409.517, It's a fact.,1
409.517,411.517," Yeah, it's a fact.",1
411.517,416.517," There's like numbers, stories, everything,",1
412.35200000000003,422.35200000000003, Yeah.,2
416.517,421.957," a lot of evidence. Yeah, it's like, no, I mean, I'm conversationed.",1
422.35200000000003,444.35200000000003, Unfortunately.,2
433.077,441.237," Let me think. Do you all watch that PBS series on Philadelphia, just",1
442.117,451.237," D.A., it's pretty good about Larry Krasner. It's pretty interesting because his",1
444.35200000000003,456.35200000000003, Yeah.,2
451.237,458.117, office was like working head on with the police and it there was one of a lot of,1
456.35200000000003,472.35200000000003, Yeah.,2
458.117,465.637, these topics that we're talking about right now. I recommend it because he's like,1
465.957,472.597," one of the, you know, handful of like kind of like quote unquote progressive D.A.'s because like D.A.'s",1
472.597,479.397, are generally there like to prosecute and be on the side of the city and like put people in jail,1
479.397,485.797, and all that. But he was he's trying to find like a more systemic solution and not do things like that,1
486.277,496.517, in the TARD. Yeah. And then he has to work against like with yeah definitely the Philadelphia,1
486.35200000000003,502.35200000000003, Yeah.,2
496.517,501.157, of police union is like to lead against him. It's pretty interesting.,1
497.21999999999997,522.22," Yeah, definitely it's more important or much better to solve the internal issues, but",0
502.35200000000003,512.352, I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
506.99699999999996,511.717, I think it was like maybe like a year or two. I was pretty excited. I don't know if you go on,1
512.197,519.797, of the PBS website. It's still available. I can look for it. I'm wondering this time.,1
512.352,520.352, I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
520.352,530.352, Yeah.,2
522.22,532.22," it is I'm not sure that it is actually a one or the other choice here, especially as I",0
522.677,527.557, It was so good. I cried watching it. I was like wow. It was too much.,1
532.22,544.02," was thinking of the 92 LA riots, which is very and like not recognizing of the internal",0
533.317,539.077, Yeah. Yeah. Is this watch with PBS passport? I don't know what that means.,1
542.277,547.2370000000001," It might be, let me see if I can watch the first episode of what happens.",1
544.02,549.22, control receives the conflicts that was in here into the history of the riots.,0
549.22,556.22, The fact that it happened in Korean home and how that factored into the relationships,0
550.352,562.352, Yeah.,2
552.517,562.277, I guess you can donate and then like your member or you have a passport holder. You can watch,1
556.22,563.82," between different minorities communities and put against each other and all that, that",0
562.352,570.352, Yeah. Yeah. I'll definitely look into it.,2
562.3570000000001,571.6370000000001, like those. Yeah. Check it out. It's interesting. It's actually very like you live in Philly.,1

568.4200000000001,574.46, It's a better way here makes the question harder I guess.,0
573.077,583.4770000000001, Should police be more be involved in more fewer aspects of the life?,1
574.46,581.46, So I'm not sure that this is actually a one way or the other choice.,0
580.352,590.352, I'm going to say a ten just from personal experience.,2
581.46,588.46, Yeah.,0

1000.177,1007.777, unrest. So that's a reaction rather than like being proactive to like prevent it like solving,1
1004.46,1022.46, Yeah.,0
1007.8570000000001,1019.297, systemic issues. Um yeah this is hard. It's like you know people who get into crime and so,1

1024.177,1031.217, no option and then they get in trouble for it and you're like you need something bad but like,1
